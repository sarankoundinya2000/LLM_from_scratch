**Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) - Notes and Code Repository**
----------------------------------------------
Welcome to the GitHub repository for "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)"! This repository contains my notes, code implementations, and additional resources from the book Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.

In this repository, I have recreated and modified key components of a transformer-based large language model, adding my own tweaks and explanations for better understanding.

Repository Contents

1. Notebooks

Notes: Detailed explanations of concepts from the book, enriched with examples and illustrations.

Conceptual pictures to visually explain key ideas like attention mechanisms, feedforward layers, and transformer blocks.

2. scratch_llm/ Folder

A Python library structure containing implementations of the major components of a transformer-based large language model.

Library Structure

feedforward.py: Implementation of the feedforward neural network layer used in transformers.

gelu.py: GELU activation function implementation.

multi_attention.py: Multi-head attention mechanism implementation.

normalization.py: Layer normalization implementation.

transformer_block.py: Transformer block combining attention, normalization, and feedforward layers.

gpt_model.py: Full GPT model implementation that ties all components together.

Key Features

Code Tweaks: Iâ€™ve made adjustments to the original code snippets from the book to improve performance, readability, and adaptability.

Explanations: Alongside the code, Iâ€™ve provided brief explanations for some of the more complex concepts to make them easier to understand.

Visual Aids: Includes images and diagrams to clarify topics like multi-head attention and the transformer architecture.


Happy learning and experimenting with LLMs! ðŸš€
