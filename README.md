# **Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)**  

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **"Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)"!** This repository contains my detailed notes, code implementations, and additional resources inspired by the book *Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)* by **Sebastian Raschka**.  

Here, I have recreated and modified key components of a transformer-based large language model, adding my own tweaks and explanations for enhanced understanding.

## **Repository Contents**  

### 1. **Notebooks**  
   - **Notes**:  
      Detailed explanations of the core concepts covered in the book, enriched with examples and illustrations.  

### 2. **`scratch_llm/` Folder**  
   This folder contains a Python library structured to include implementations of the primary components of a transformer-based large language model.  

   #### **Library Structure**  
   - **`feedforward.py`**  
     Implementation of the feedforward neural network layer used in transformers.  
   - **`gelu.py`**  
     Implementation of the GELU activation function.  
   - **`multi_attention.py`**  
     Implementation of the multi-head attention mechanism.  
   - **`normalization.py`**  
     Layer normalization implementation.  
   - **`transformer_block.py`**  
     Transformer block combining attention, normalization, and feedforward layers.  
   - **`gpt_model.py`**  
     Full GPT model implementation, tying all components together to create a functioning language model.

1. **Learning**  
   - Use the notes and conceptual pictures in the notebooks to understand how a transformer-based large language model works.  
2. **Experimentation**  
   - Modify and experiment with the code in the `scratch_llm` folder to build your own versions of an LLM.  
3. **Research**  
   - Reference the repository to enhance your understanding of key components, such as attention mechanisms and transformer blocks.
